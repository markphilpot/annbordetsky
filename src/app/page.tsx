        <h2>how I work with founders</h2>
        <h4>
          <Highlight>before it’s obvious</Highlight>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Investing at seed and series A, primarily in founders building in
          emerging, high growth (big if true) markets with a vision for a
          category defining application or platform company. Deep conviction in
          founder market fit, product velocity, technical edge and correct
          timing on the idea. Post-investment, focus on helping the founder
          reach escape velocity (via network, intros, assists, visibility). I
          also help technical founders find their key early business hires.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <Highlight>before it’s inevitable</Highlight>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Partnering founders at the early-growth stage of company building once
          there’s undeniable PMF, exciting revenue growth and clear inflection
          point to scale. Inevitability comes from building an exceptional
          execution machine, accelerating GTM and establishing a strong brand
          moat (not just VC ‘heat’). I like to work with founders on what I know
          best, building and scaling business functions that drive growth (GTM,
          Biz Dev, Partnerships, Growth, Mktg), competition chess game, compound
          product strategy and attracting A+ leadership talent.

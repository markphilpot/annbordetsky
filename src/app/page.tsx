        </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            When you commit, give it 200%. Bring a founder mentality regardless
            of title or tenure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be an honest broker. Trust and transparency go together, they forge
            real bonds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Believe in the power of teams. Building high-performing teams is how
            you keep winning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Top talent thrives in meritocracies, not mediocracies. Give people
            room to grow.
          </li>
          <li>In negotiations, don’t play zero sum games. Grow the pie.</li>
          <li>
            Failure is a feature, not a bug. Bounce back, learn, get better.
          </li>
          <li>
            Debate until you understand each other. It’s more valuable than
            consensus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be present in conversations, especially 1-1s. Engage in active
            listening.
          </li>
          <li>
            Emotional self-regulation is an essential skill in leadership. Do
            the work on yourself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Say thank you and tell people you appreciate them. We’re not made of
            stone!

          Selectively partnering founders at the early growth stage, when there
          is undeniable market pull and exciting product growth but the company
          isn’t inevitable yet. At this stage, it’s about dominating the
          category and building the team that will build a durable company.
          Inevitability comes from exceptional execution, scalable go-to-market
          and establishing a brand moat (not just VC heat). Assist founders on:
